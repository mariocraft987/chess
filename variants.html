    <h1>Chess Variants</h1>
    <p>Chess variants are variations of Chess with different rules, or pieces.</p>

    <h2>Chess960/Fischer Random</h2>
    <p>Chess960 aka Fischer Random Chess is a variant that randomizes the back rank pieces on both sides, created by Bobby Fischer.</p>

    <h2>Antichess/Losing Chess</h2>
    <p>Antichess/Losing Chess is a variant, with the goal being to lose all your pieces, or get stalemated.</p>

    <h2>Infinite Chess</h2>
    <p>Infinite Chess is a variant, in which you play a normal game of chess, except the board is infinite, which allows pieces to move on forever.</p>

    <h2>Atomic Chess</h2>
    <p>Atomic Chess is a variant, for when you capture a piece, it explodes your piece and the piece you captured, also exploding pieces in range of one square horizonatally, vertically, and diagonally.</p>

    <h2>Duck Chess</h2>
    <p>Duck chess is a variant made by Dr. Tim Paulden in 2016. Duck Chess is a normal game of chess, except after each move, you move a rubber duck to a vacant square, which acts like a brick, blocking other pieces from moving across or to it's square.</p>
